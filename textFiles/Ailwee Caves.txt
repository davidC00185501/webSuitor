The Ailwee Caves in County Clare consist of over a kilometer of twisting passages and was formed by melting glacial water over 1.5 
million years ago. The Caves remained undiscovered until 1944 when a farmer Jack McGann followed his dog which was chasing a rabbit 
and stumbled across the entrance. The farmer kept this discovery to himself for 30 years exploring the caves with the use of candlelight.
The bones of bears were found in the caves and it is speculated that the caves were the last den of bears in Ireland before they went 
extinct.
