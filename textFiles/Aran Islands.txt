The Aran Islands are comprised of three islands off of the coast of galway bay. As the Islands are so remote and issolated they strive 
to be self sufficient to cut down on importing goods to the islands by using electric cars and solar power.  Recently the islands joined 
a study to see if hydrogen can be used to heat homes and power their cars and boats. The culture on the islands remained unchanged since 
ancient times and as such gaelic is still spoken by the majority or the islands inhabitants. There are a number of shipwrecks to see on 
the island and the stone walls seen throughout have been in place since the island was first inhabited over 2,500 years ago.
