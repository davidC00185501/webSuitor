Ben Bulben is a mountain range in County Sligo. The mountain rises over 500 metres and is flat at the summit, because of the structure it is known as the tabletop mountain.
The mountain range was formed 320 million years ago during the last ice age.  With the colder climate and chilly winds, wildlife in the area are unique to the area with species
of hares, foxes and other wildlife which thrive in the colder climate.  The mountain is a popular climbing destination although the north side is more dangerous as it faces the 
Atlantic Ocean and takes the brunt of the high speed winds.
