The cliffs of Moher in County Clare stretch over 8 kilometres in length and take approximetely 2 hours to walk the trails each way. 
When walking the trails it will be possible to see over 20 species of birds.  With over 30,000 birds making the cliffs their home each year, 
it is the largest mainland colony of birds in Ireland. The highest point of the cliffs is 214 metres above sea level at O'Brians Tower.  
O'Brians tower was built during 1835 when young nobles would travel around Europe.  Cornelius O'Brian saw the oppertunity presented 
and built the tower with the idea to charge for admittance to the highest view possible of the cliffs.
