Dublin Castle Was built during the 13th century for the British seat of power while they ruled Ireland. It was also used by the Viceroy 
of Ireland for ceremonial and administrative purposes. During April 1684 a large fire laid ruin to most to the castle which was later rebuilt 
and the functionality became less of a fortress and more of a palace. The last Viceroy of Ireland handed over Dublin Castle to Micheal Collins 
and the government of the newly independant irish state in january 1922 as the end of British presence in Ireland following the war for 
independance in 1916.
