Giants Causeway in County Antrim was formed by volcanic eruptions 50 - 60 million years ago. This natural phenomena features 400,000 
columns of Basalt blocks mainly shaped in a hexagonal shape staggered in height forming steps. The highest column reaches a height of 12 
metres. Irish Folklore tells the story that the causeway was built by a giant in Ireland that wanted to travel to Scotland and fight the 
giants there. However upon seeing the size of giants in Scotland, he fled back to Ireland tearing up the road to slow the chasing giant.
