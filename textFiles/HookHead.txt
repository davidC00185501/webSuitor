Hook Head in County Wexford is located on the east side of the estuary for three rivers and is on the Hook peninsula. Hook Head is the location of the 
oldest working lighthouse in the world. In the early 13th century, the lord of Leinster, the Knight Templar William Marshal founded the town of Ross to 
act as the port for Leinster. William built Hook tower as a landmark and light tower to guide ships to port in Ross. The Light was provided by a coal fire beacon.
Monks were installed as custodians of the light house to maintain and operate the lighthouse for many years until Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1540.
By the 17th century numerous shipwrecks caused the lighthouses to be put back to use. From the 17th century to present the lighthouse has been updated to use oil, 
then gas in combination with clockwork technology to give the light a blinking effect. Finally the lighthouse switched to electricity in 1972. Today the lighthouse 
is over 800 years old and is still in working condition.
