Kilkenny Castle was built during 1172 as a wooden castle to overlook the crossing point for the river Nore. 30 years later the castle was rebuilt 
in stone to better defend the area with four circular towers. When the Govener of kilkenny died in 1381 the castle was sold to the butler family.
During the 17th Century, Oliver Cromwell laid siege to kilkenny and damaged the castle. In the years following this the castle was rebuilt and a new 
gateway was designed for the south wall. In 1922 Republican forces took control of the castle and was under siege for two days during the Irish civil war, 
following this the heavily damaged castle was returned to the butler family. In 1967 the butler family sold the castle to the castle restoration commitee 
for £50, as his family took pride in the castle and didnt want to see it deteriorate any further.
