The Rock of Cashel is a historic site in County Tipperary. Prior to the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the rock was home to the Kings of Munster. The oldest 
building that can be found in the ruins is the 28 metre tall circular tower that was built during the 11th century. The other main attraction that can be viewed at 
the ruins are the remains of saint patricks cathedral that was built between 1235 - 1270. The plans to restore the cathedral were overturned by the archbishop at the 
time by claiming it was impossible to re-roof despite advice to the contrary and the roof of the cathedral was ordered removed in 1749. The damage to the ruins were 
caused by multiple battles in the 12th century and fires later. The people living at the historic site lived challenging lives as the hill leading up to the entrance 
was too steep for horses to traverse so entrance could only be made on foot and supplies had to be carried by hand.
