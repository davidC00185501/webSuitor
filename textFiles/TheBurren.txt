The Burren is a karst landscape situated between North County Clare and South County Galway, the area is mainly comprised of limestone and extends over 350km2. The Aran Islands 
were once a part of the Burren until the end of the last ice age when the sea level rose. The landscape as seen today was formed when glaciers during the ice age erroded the soil 
and other soluble materials from the area. There is an estimated 1000 wild goats living in the burren they live off of the available vegitation in the area and account for 20% of 
the number of wild goats in Ireland. Other wildlife in the Burren include hares, foxes, falcons and many other mammals and smaller birds.
